            I used to hate computers, I didn't even own a proper one. I always
            was a console type of guy.
          </p>

          <h5>2017</h5>
          <p>
            I've done great in my studies until I made it to university studying
            a mix of science and technology. <b>I felt lost.</b>
          </p>

          <h5>2020</h5>
          <p>I dropout of university to search my true passion.</p>

          <h5>2021</h5>
          <p>
            my passion turned out to be <b>coding.</b> I went for an associate degree
            in web and mobile development where we studied different technologies
            and principles.
          </p>

          <h5>2023</h5>
          <p>
            I fell in love with <b>laravel</b> and building,
            <b>the sky is the limit.</b> I landed my first internship during a beachless
            summer and I got hired after that summer, as a full-time full-stack developer.
          </p>

          <h5>2025</h5>
